- Vehicle counting and detection for parking
- With this project I was aiming to solve the parking related issues in the College, which will help campus authorities and Guards in smooth monitoring of vehicles inside or if required outside the campus parking too.
- This is a Python script for real-time vehicle detection and counting using OpenCV and YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection. It utilizes a pre-trained YOLO model to detect cars, motorbikes, buses, and trucks in a video feed. The script tracks these vehicles and counts the number of vehicles passing through defined lines on the screen. It can also display the total count and trigger a "Limit reached" warning when the count exceeds 5 in the down section. Additionally, the code saves the count data to a CSV file named 'data.csv' upon completion.
